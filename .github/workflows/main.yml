# Exercise 1
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

# name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
# on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
#   push:
#     branches: [ "main" ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  # build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    # runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      # - name: Run a one-line script
        # run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      # - name: Run a multi-line script
        # run: |
          # echo Add other actions to build,
          # echo test, and deploy your project.
